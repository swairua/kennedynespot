            <p className="text-muted-foreground">

Before deciding to trade, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. You should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.
